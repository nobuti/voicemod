# Voicemod code challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I'm using `yarn` as task runner, but `npm` works as well, as a rule of thumb, change `yarn` by `npm run`.

## Install

To install all dependencies, in the project directory, you should run:

```
yarn
```

If you prefer npm:

```
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
